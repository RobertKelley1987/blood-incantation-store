- product filter on all items page
- Contact form needs errors for missing inputs etc...
- Test and style PmtIntentError element
- Need footer
- Success page with confirmation number and order summary
- Document return values and required args in custom hooks / helper functions
- Review button component for deleting. Maybe add HTMLProps from react that lets you
pass all normal button props. Research that.
- make sure local storage cart is clearing on checkout
- submit function in checkout form is a nightmare
- google tracking form state with errors in react. I feel like 
there is a better way.
